Arithmetic Helpers & Bit Statistics
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:188: Replace this byte-by-byte scan with the lookup-table based statistics collector validated in the BitStats benchmarks so zero runs leverage cached results instead of recomputing per bit.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:15: Replace this hand-rolled binary GCD with the shared subtract-free ladder from GpuUInt128BinaryGcdBenchmarks so wide operands reuse the optimized helper instead of repeating the slower shift/subtract loop on both CPU and GPU paths.

Divisor Cycle Cache & Generation
- EvenPerfectBitScanner/Program.cs:146: Wire GenerateGpu to the unrolled-hex kernel that led the MersenneDivisorCycleLengthGpuBenchmarks once it lands.
- EvenPerfectBitScanner/Program.cs:167: Keep a single cached block loaded from disk and honor the configured device when computing ad-hoc cycles for divisors that fall outside that snapshot instead of queuing generation of additional blocks.
- EvenPerfectBitScanner/Program.cs:171: Stop reloading the full snapshot once the ad-hoc path streams results straight from the configured device without persisting them, so memory stays bounded while preserving the single cached block strategy.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:212: Route this miss to an ephemeral single-cycle computation on the device selected by the current configuration (and skip persisting the result) when the divisor falls outside the in-memory snapshot so we respect the large-p memory limits and avoid extra cache locks.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:245: Port this UInt128 path to the unrolled-hex cycle calculator so wide divisors stop relying on the slow shift-and-subtract loop measured in the GPU benchmarks.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:464: Reuse the remainder-tracking update from the cycle heuristic so repeated divisions disappear from this loop.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:484: Evaluate folding the remainder-tracking mechanism into PollardRho64 so the walk leverages previously computed residues.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:493: Investigate computing this quotient via remainder tracking or reciprocal multiplication to avoid the division.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:786: Replace this modulo-based filter with the cached Mod3/Mod5/Mod7/Mod11 helpers so the CPU generator stops paying for `%` in the small-prime sieve and lines up with the divisor-cycle pipeline.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:794: Migrate this generation path to the shared unrolled-hex calculator so the CPU generator matches the GPU benchmark leader for large divisors.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:869: Swap these modulo checks for the cached Mod3/Mod5/Mod7/Mod11 helpers so range initialization avoids repeated `%` calls before the unrolled-hex pipeline takes over.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:919: Replace this modulo sieve with the cached Mod helpers once the divisor-cycle cache is mandatory so cycle enumeration can drop the slower `%` operations in this hot loop.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:372: If the cache lacks this cycle, immediately schedule the configured device (GPU by default) to compute it on the fly and skip inserting it into the cache so wide-order factoring can still leverage cycle stepping without breaching the memory cap or introducing extra synchronization.

Primality & Order Screening
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:477: Benchmark PrimeTester.IsPrimeInternal against Open.Numeric.Primes on the EvenPerfectBitScanner workloads to confirm the faster option for wide composites.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:119: When the shared cycle snapshot cannot serve this divisor, trigger an on-demand GPU computation (respecting the configured device) without promoting the result into the cache so the order calculator still benefits from cycle stepping while keeping the single-block memory plan intact.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:132: Replace this `%` driven factor peeling with the divisor-cycle aware factoring helper so large orders reuse the cached remainders highlighted in the latest divisor-cycle benchmarks instead of recomputing slow modulo checks.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:279: Swap this modulo check for the shared small-prime cycle filter once the divisor-cycle cache is mandatory, matching the PrimeTester improvements noted in the CPU sieve benchmarks.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:432: Replace this direct `%` test with the shared divisor-cycle filter once the UInt128 path is wired into the cached cycle tables so wide candidates skip the slow modulo checks during primality pre-filtering.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:447: Fold these reductions into the multiply-high trick captured in Mod3BenchmarkResults so the UInt128 modulo helpers avoid `%` altogether and align with the faster CPU/GPU residue filters.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:456: Replace the `% 5` operations with the precomputed multiply-high constants from the Mod5 benchmarks so the UInt128 path matches the 64-bit helpers without extra modulo instructions.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:476: Inline the lookup-based Mod7 reducer validated in the residue benchmarks so this helper stops relying on `% 7` in hot loops and mirrors the optimized CPU cycle filters.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:500: Precompute the 2^64 â‰¡ 6 folding constants once so this path stops recomputing `% 10` on each half and instead uses the span-based lookup captured in Mod10BenchmarkResults.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:523: Collapse this Mod10 switch into the shared lookup table from the CLI benchmarks so we avoid the nested switch expressions once the pooled residue tables become available.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Numbers.cs:16: Populate this table from the UInt128 residue benchmarks so GPU kernels can pull precomputed constants without re-deriving them at runtime.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Numbers.cs:18: Extend the table with cached Mod3/Mod5 folding constants so both CPU and GPU residue helpers can reuse the benchmarked multiply-high reductions without recomputing them per call.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UIntExtensions.cs:9: Only add Mod7/Mod11 lookup helpers once we have a variant that beats the `%` baseline (current prototypes lose per Mod7/Mod11 benchmarks).

Montgomery Primitives
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:440: Investigate replacing this manual decomposition with the UInt128-based implementation for CPU callers; the latest benchmarks show the intrinsic path is an order of magnitude faster, while GPU code can keep using GpuUInt128.MulHigh.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:474: Replace this `%` with the Montgomery folding helper highlighted in MulMod64Benchmarks so the modular exponentiation avoids the slow integer division before the ladder even starts.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:493: Replace this fallback with the UInt128 Montgomery helper measured fastest in MulMod64Benchmarks so CPU callers stop paying for triple modulo operations.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:69: Prototype a UInt128-native Pow2MontgomeryModWindowed path that matches the GPU implementation once a faster modular multiplication helper is available, so we can revisit removing the GPU struct dependency without regressing benchmarks.

Cycle-Aware Modular Arithmetic

Status & Progress Reporting
- PerfectNumbers.Core/Cpu/MersenneNumberDivisorByDivisorCpuTester.cs:296: Replace this modulo with the ring-buffer style counter (subtract loop) used in the fast CLI status benchmarks so we avoid `%` in this hot loop while still wrapping progress correctly.

Cycle Remainder Steppers
- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:28: Inline this reset at the call sites so the hot loops reuse struct reinitialization measured fastest in MersenneDivisorCycleLengthGpuBenchmarks, avoiding the extra method call when scanners need to restart stepping.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:42: Swap this `%` for the shared divisor-cycle remainder helper so initialization reuses the cached cycle deltas benchmarked faster than on-the-fly modulo work, matching the MersenneDivisorCycleLengthGpuBenchmarks winner for both CPU and GPU call sites.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:72: Replace this `%` with the UInt128-aware cycle reducer so large deltas use the cached subtraction ladder instead of falling back to the slower modulo implementation.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:85: Route this `%` through the shared divisor-cycle helper so repeated wrap-arounds avoid modulo operations and match the benchmarked fast path highlighted in MersenneDivisorCycleLengthGpuBenchmarks.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:96: Expose these fields directly once the residue scanners adopt the single-cycle helper so the hot path can read them without paying for an additional wrapper call per iteration.
