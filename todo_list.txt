Arithmetic Helpers & Bit Statistics
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:188: Replace this byte-by-byte scan with the lookup-table based statistics collector validated in the BitStats benchmarks so zero runs leverage cached results instead of recomputing per bit.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:15: Replace this hand-rolled binary GCD with the shared subtract-free ladder from GpuUInt128BinaryGcdBenchmarks so wide operands reuse the optimized helper instead of repeating the slower shift/subtract loop on both CPU and GPU paths.

Divisor Cycle Cache & Generation
- EvenPerfectBitScanner/Program.cs:146: Wire GenerateGpu to the unrolled-hex kernel that led the MersenneDivisorCycleLengthGpuBenchmarks once it lands.
- EvenPerfectBitScanner/Program.cs:167: Keep a single cached block loaded from disk and honor the configured device when computing ad-hoc cycles for divisors that fall outside that snapshot instead of queuing generation of additional blocks.
- EvenPerfectBitScanner/Program.cs:171: Stop reloading the full snapshot once the ad-hoc path streams results straight from the configured device without persisting them, so memory stays bounded while preserving the single cached block strategy.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:212: Route this miss to an ephemeral single-cycle computation on the device selected by the current configuration (and skip persisting the result) when the divisor falls outside the in-memory snapshot so we respect the large-p memory limits and avoid extra cache locks.

- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:869: Swap these modulo checks for the cached Mod3/Mod5/Mod7/Mod11 helpers so range initialization avoids repeated `%` calls before the unrolled-hex pipeline takes over.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:919: Replace this modulo sieve with the cached Mod helpers once the divisor-cycle cache is mandatory so cycle enumeration can drop the slower `%` operations in this hot loop.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:994: Expose a GPU-first branch here so high divisors leverage the ProcessEightBitWindows kernel measured fastest in CycleLengthGpuVsCpuBenchmarks, returning the result without storing it in the shared cache.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:372: If the cache lacks this cycle, immediately schedule the configured device (GPU by default) to compute it on the fly and skip inserting it into the cache so wide-order factoring can still leverage cycle stepping without breaching the memory cap or introducing extra synchronization.

Primality & Order Screening
- PerfectNumbers.Core/MersenneDivisorCycles.cs:477: Benchmark PrimeTester.IsPrimeInternal against Open.Numeric.Primes on the EvenPerfectBitScanner workloads to confirm the faster option for wide composites.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:119: When the shared cycle snapshot cannot serve this divisor, trigger an on-demand GPU computation (respecting the configured device) without promoting the result into the cache so the order calculator still benefits from cycle stepping while keeping the single-block memory plan intact.

- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:500: Precompute the 2^64 ≡ 6 folding constants once so this path stops recomputing `% 10` on each half and instead uses the span-based lookup captured in Mod10BenchmarkResults.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:523: Collapse this Mod10 switch into the shared lookup table from the CLI benchmarks so we avoid the nested switch expressions once the pooled residue tables become available.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Numbers.cs:16: Populate this table from the UInt128 residue benchmarks so GPU kernels can pull precomputed constants without re-deriving them at runtime.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Numbers.cs:18: Extend the table with cached Mod3/Mod5 folding constants so both CPU and GPU residue helpers can reuse the benchmarked multiply-high reductions without recomputing them per call.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UIntExtensions.cs:9: Only add Mod7/Mod11 lookup helpers once we have a variant that beats the `%` baseline (current prototypes lose per Mod7/Mod11 benchmarks).

Montgomery Primitives
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:440: Investigate replacing this manual decomposition with the UInt128-based implementation for CPU callers; the latest benchmarks show the intrinsic path is an order of magnitude faster, while GPU code can keep using GpuUInt128.MulHigh.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:474: Replace this `%` with the Montgomery folding helper highlighted in MulMod64Benchmarks so the modular exponentiation avoids the slow integer division before the ladder even starts.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:493: Replace this fallback with the UInt128 Montgomery helper measured fastest in MulMod64Benchmarks so CPU callers stop paying for triple modulo operations.

- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:1097: Swap this modulo with the shared UInt128 cycle remainder helper once available so CRT powmods reuse cached reductions in the windowed ladder, avoiding the `%` cost highlighted in Pow2MontgomeryModCycleComputationBenchmarks.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:1144: Replace this `% modulusCandidate` with the cached residue helper derived from Mod10_8_5_3Benchmarks so CRT composition avoids repeated modulo divisions when combining residues for large divisor sets.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ULongExtensions.cs:1153: Swap this final `% modulus` with the pooled remainder cache so the CRT result write-back avoids one more division, aligning with the optimizations captured in Mod10_8_5_3Benchmarks.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/UInt128Extensions.cs:388: Switch this divisor-order powmod to the ProcessEightBitWindows helper so the cycle factoring loop benefits from the faster windowed pow2 ladder measured in CPU benchmarks.

Status & Progress Reporting
- PerfectNumbers.Core/Cpu/MersenneNumberDivisorByDivisorCpuTester.cs:296: Replace this modulo with the ring-buffer style counter (subtract loop) used in the fast CLI status benchmarks so we avoid `%` in this hot loop while still wrapping progress correctly.

Cycle Remainder Steppers

- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:42: Swap this `%` for the shared divisor-cycle remainder helper so initialization reuses the cached cycle deltas benchmarked faster than on-the-fly modulo work, matching the MersenneDivisorCycleLengthGpuBenchmarks winner for both CPU and GPU call sites.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:72: Replace this `%` with the UInt128-aware cycle reducer so large deltas use the cached subtraction ladder instead of falling back to the slower modulo implementation.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:85: Route this `%` through the shared divisor-cycle helper so repeated wrap-arounds avoid modulo operations and match the benchmarked fast path highlighted in MersenneDivisorCycleLengthGpuBenchmarks.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/CycleRemainderStepper.cs:96: Expose these fields directly once the residue scanners adopt the single-cycle helper so the hot path can read them without paying for an additional wrapper call per iteration.

Exponent Remainder & Montgomery Windowing
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ExponentRemainderStepper.cs:47: Route these state resets through the ProcessEightBitWindows helper once the scalar Pow2MontgomeryMod implementation adopts it so delta stepping inherits the benchmarked 2× gains for large exponents.
- PerfectNumbers.Core/ExponentRemainderStepper.cs:57: Once divisor cycle lengths are mandatory, pull the delta multiplier from the single-block divisor-cycle snapshot so we can skip the powmod entirely and reuse the cached Montgomery residue ladder highlighted in MersenneDivisorCycleLengthGpuBenchmarks.
