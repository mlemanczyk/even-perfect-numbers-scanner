# GPU Kernel Refactor Audit Progress

## Review Summary
- [x] MersenneNumberDivisorByDivisorGpuTester: Confirmed kernel bindings, resource pooling, and filtering comments (including Montgomery data handling notes) remain intact with no functional changes.
- [x] MersenneNumberDivisorGpuTester: Verified the divisibility helper, candidate bootstrap, and divisor-cycle integration preserve their original comments and TODO guidance verbatim.
- [x] MersenneNumberIncrementalGpuTester: Checked that the incremental scan workflow, residue preparation comments, and TODO placeholders stayed untouched.
- [x] MersenneNumberLucasLehmerGpuTester: Audited the Lucasâ€“Lehmer kernels, TODO annotations, and GPU limiter usage to ensure they were moved verbatim.
- [x] MersenneNumberOrderGpuTester: Confirmed residue automaton notes, TODO entries, and kernel selections remain unchanged.
- [x] MersenneNumberResidueGpuTester: Ensured the residue scan notes about cycle integration and buffer zeroing are still present without logic edits.
- [x] NttGpuMath: Reviewed cached kernel launchers and TODO lists to verify that only structural moves occurred.
- [x] Pow2OddPowerTable (PrimeOrderGpuHeuristics partial): Checked the odd-power ladder implementation and comments for exact retention.
- [x] PrimeOrderGpuHeuristics: Validated that partial factor kernels, capability overrides, and extensive TODO documentation remain verbatim.
- [x] ReadOnlyGpuUInt128: Confirmed helper constructors and implicit conversions were untouched by the refactor.

## Next Step
Audit complete for the GPU namespace after the kernel extraction. No further classes remain pending in this pass.
