- Ensure the GPU order path reroutes to the CPU heuristics whenever exponents or moduli exceed the currently implemented device integer widths (GpuUInt128/GpuUInt256/GpuUInt512), so overflow never propagates into incorrect results.
- Implement the GPU heuristics for PrimeOrderCalculator using ILGPU. Reuse the numeric type compatibility probe results to select between EInteger, ERational, GpuUInt128, or any new GPU-specific big-integer representations, guarantee parity with the CPU heuristic algorithm (including 128-bit primes), prefer the shift-first multiply/shift variant to stay within device ranges, and wire the calculator through the accelerator path.
- Extend the GPU numeric type probe to cover proposed custom types such as GpuUInt256 and GpuUInt512 once their definitions are available so we can plan the wide-order heuristics on the device.
