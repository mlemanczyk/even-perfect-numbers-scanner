- Prototype a UInt128-native Pow2MontgomeryModWindowed path that matches the GPU implementation once a faster modular multiplication helper is available, so we can revisit removing the GPU struct dependency without regressing benchmarks.
- Mirror the complete CPU heuristic cycle algorithm on the GPU path so both implementations stay aligned.
- Extend the GPU numeric type probe to cover proposed custom types such as GpuUInt256 and GpuUInt512 once their definitions are available so we can plan the wide-order heuristics on the device.
