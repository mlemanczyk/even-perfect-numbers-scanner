- Swap PrimeOrderGpuHeuristics.Pow2ModCpu for the existing Pow2MontgomeryModWindowed helper and plan the same windowed ladder for the GPU kernel implementation.
- Extend the GPU numeric type probe to cover proposed custom types such as GpuUInt256 and GpuUInt512 once their definitions are available so we can plan the wide-order heuristics on the device.
